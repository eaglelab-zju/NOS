### Study Design and Interview Framework

Participants were instructed to interact with two distinct focus modes on various app interfaces. Following this interaction, participants were questioned about their comprehension of the page content and their perception of differences between the two focus modes. Specific differences and focus-related issues were explained to them. Subsequently, participants responded to the following questions:

1. Rate the appropriateness of each focus mode.
2. Indicate the frequency of encountering such focus issues during regular usage.
3. Evaluate the impact of these focus issues on usability.
4. Describe their ideal expectations for resolving such issues.
5. Provide additional thoughts or suggestions related to these focus issues.
